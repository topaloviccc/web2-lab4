		<h1>Cat</h1>

			The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat, is a
			small carnivorous mammal. It is an obligate carnivore, requiring a
			predominantly meat-based diet. Its retractable claws are adapted to
			killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong,
			flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision
			and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a
			solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication
			includes meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, grunting,
			and body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
			frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It
			secretes and perceives pheromones. Cat intelligence is evident in
			its ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems.
			Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in
			temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with
			litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.

		<p class="box">
			The domestic cat is the only domesticated species of the family
			Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
			domestication of the cat started in the Near East around 7500 BCE.
			Today, the domestic cat occurs across the globe and is valued by
			humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. It is
			commonly kept as a pet, working cat, and pedigreed cat shown at cat
			fancy events. Out of the estimated 600 million domestic cats
			worldwide, 400 million reside in Asia, including 58 million in
			China. The United States leads in cat ownership with 73.8 million
			cats, followed by the United Kingdom with approximately 10.9 million
			cats. It also ranges freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact.
			Pet abandonment contributes to increasing of the global feral cat
			population, which has driven the decline of bird, mammal, and
			reptile species. Population control includes spaying and neutering.

		<h2>Domestication</h2>
		<hr class="line" />
		<p class="box">
			It was long thought that the domestication of the cat began in
			ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BCE.
			However, the earliest known indication for the taming of an African
			wildcat was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in
			Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BCE.
			Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the
			inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat
			and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern
			mainland
